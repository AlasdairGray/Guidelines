		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
 Good descriptions of data are essential to finding, understanding and ultimately reusing data. However, data is all too often published without adequate descriptions of its provenance. A
<br><br>  
 Here, we describe nanopublications, a community-driven approach to representing structured data along with its provenance into a single publishable and citable entity. A nanopublication minimally consists of an assertion, the provenance of the assertion, and the provenance of the nanopublication. The nanopublication is represented with and may be queried using Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL). Nanopublications also feature a mechanism to ensure the integrity of data and its provenance. Access to provenance enables users to assess the trustworthiness of data and provides a mechanism by which authors and institutions may be acknowledged for their contribution to the global knowledge graph. Nanopublications may be used to expose quantitative and qualitative data, as well as hypotheses, claims, and negative results that usually goes unpublished. With nanopublications, it is possible to disseminate individual data as independent publications with or without an accompanying research article.
 <br><br>
 This document describes the structure of nanopublications and offers guidelines in their composition, implementation and use. It was produced by members of the Concept Web Alliance (CWA), an open collaborative community that is actively addressing the challenges associated with the production, management, interoperability and analysis of unprecedented volumes of data.

	<section>
		<h3>Primer</h3>
<p>
Nanopublications combines an assertion, the provenance of the assertion, and the provenance of the nanopublication into a single publishable and citable entity. Both the assertion and provenance are represented as RDF graphs.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>assertion graph</strong> of the nanopublication contains an assertion that is comprised of one or more RDF triples (subject-predicate-object tuples). An assertion is a proposition that is falsifiable, that is to say we can test whether the proposition is true or false. Examples of assertions include 

<trastuzumab, is-indicated-for, breast-cancer>
{
 <BRCA1-gene, is-involved-in, breast-cancer>,
 <BRCA1-gene, encodes, BRCA1-protein>
 <BRCA1-protein, is-expressed-in, breast>
}
 </p>
 
<p>
The <strong>provenance graph</strong> of the nanopublication contains one or more RDF triples that provide information about the <strong>assertion</strong>. A nanopublication MUST have a provenance graph identifier linked to the assertion graph identifier. Provenance means, ‘how this came to be’, and may include any statement that discusses how the assertion was generated, who generated it, when was it generated, where was the assertion obtained from, and any other similar information. Examples of assertional provenance include

{
<assertion, prov:wasGeneratedAt, x>
<assertion, ..., y>
}
</p>

<p>
The <strong>publicationInfo graph</strong> contains one or more RDF triples that offer provenance information regarding the nanopublication itself. In this case, the subject of the triples in the publicationInfo graph MUST be the nanopublication URI and SHOULD contain attribution and timestamp. Examples of the nanopublication provenance include: 

{
<:np, dc:creator, "Paul Groth"^^xsd:string>
<:np, dc:created, "2012-10-26T12:45:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime>
}

<h3>Specification</h3>

<p class="note"><strong>Tobias:</strong>
These criteria are taken from <a href="https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-java">nanopub-java</a>,
and are up for discussion.
</p>

<p>A nanopublication MUST comply with all of the following criteria to be considered well-formed:</p>

<ul>
<li>A nanopublication consists of a set of RDF quads (i.e. subject-predicate-object + context)</li>
<li>The context (i.e. graph) of each triple has to be specified as a valid URI (i.e. no null values)</li>
<li>There is exactly one quad of the form '[N] rdf:type np:Nanopublication [C]', where [N] is the nanopublication URI, and [C] is the context URI</li>
<li>There is exactly one quad of the form '[N] np:hasAssertion [A] [C]', where [N] is the nanopublication URI, [A] is the assertion URI, and [C] is the context URI</li>
<li>There is exactly one quad of the form '[N] np:hasProvenance [P] [C]', where [N] is the nanopublication URI, [P] is the provenance URI, and [C] is the context URI</li>
<li>There is exactly one quad of the form '[N] np:hasPublicationInfo [I] [C]', [N] is the nanopublication URI, [I] is the nanopublication information URI, and [C] is the context URI</li>
<li>There are zero or more quads of the form '[S] rdfg:subGraphOf [G] [C]', where [C] is the context URI and [S] is one of [N] or [A] or [P]</li>
<li>The URIs for [N] and [C] may be the same.</li>
<li>The URIs for [A], [P], [I], and [S] must all be different</li>
<li>Triples must be placed in one of [N] or [A] or [P] or [I] or [C]</li>
<li>Triples in [A] or [P] or [I] must have the respective graph as their context URI [C].</li>
<li>Triples in [P] must refer to [A] or a supergraph of [A].</li>
<li>Triples in [I] must refer to [N] or a supergraph of [N].</li>
</ul>

<h3>Integrity Key</h3>
[Alasdair, Paul, Mark]

<ul>
<li> use cases.... why have integrity keys?</li>
<li> in principle, integrity keys are unique to nanopubs</li>
<li> but integrity keys are not a part of the nanopub</li>
<li> keys are organization independent</li>
<li> we need to recommend an algorithm (an RDF hasher)</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Tobias:</strong> I think integrity keys should be part of the nanopub URI. In this way, every reference to a nanopub
comes with the possibility to check its integrity. If one nanopub cites another, the integrity key of the cited
nanopub flows into the integrity key for the citing one. Therefore, the integrity key ensures not just the integrity of the
respective nanopub, but also of all cited nanopub (and nanopubs cited by the cited nanopubs, etc.). This is inspired
by how the Git versioning system uses hash values to identify commits. I started to implement this as a proof-of-concept.
See the link below.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Michel:</strong>Agree with Tobias - it's a major advance to include integrity checks.</p>

<section><h3>Nanopublication Compliant RDF for Large Data Sets</h3>
<p>
Big Data & nanopublication…. [Zuotian, Erik, Alasdair]
</p>

<p>
To convert large existing datasets into nanopublications, we recommend using the Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets ( VoID  http://www.w3.org/TR/void/ ) to create a nanopublication compliant RDF (ncRDF) description of the data. In this way we make each entry in the dataset (e.g. data row or sample value) referenceable, which in turn makes it possible to specify that a particular assertion was derived from a specific row of the original dataset.
</p>

<p>
ncRDF is an intermediate step between the dataset as it is, and nanopublications. Rather than creating an extensive domain model, the RDF dataset uses a simple descriptive model. In practice this means that all data items from the original dataset are transformed (no pre-selection) and that all values remain the same (no normalization or rounding). Furthermore, simple ad-hoc ontologies can be used to provide entity and predicate descriptions: full semantic modeling is only required for the nanopublication itself. See figure.
</p>

<p>
An example of the use ncRDF in exposing a large dataset is given in the FANTOM5 nanopublictation template. Here, each row of the raw dataset is transformed to a ‘CagePeak resource’. Using the void:inDataset predicate, each CagePeak is linked back to the resource for the entire dataset. Subsequent predicates connect the CagePeak to entities that represent columns of the raw dataset.

<section><h3>Best & Good Practices</h3>

<p>
[everyone.... after we practice some]
</p>

<p>
How nanopublications relate to traditional publications…
</p>

<p>
Immutability & versions & deprecations…
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Nanopublications SHOULD be immutable
    <li> immutability applies only to the nanopublication itself and not to resources linked to it... but creators SHOULD choose stable URIs when possible. 
    <li> Versioning: we use prov ‘hasRevision’
    <li> recommendations on deprecations, retraction... ‘hasStatus’ ? 
    <li> use of blank nodes# URIs
    <li> # URIs... best practice for URIs (persistant & registry)   ...nanopub.og...
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Tobias:</strong> I would say nanopublications ARE immutable. With an approach like hashURIs (see link above), immutability can be enforced (because the integrity key is part of the nanopub URI).</p>

<p>
Whenever possible, existing ontologies and URIs should be used in semantic markup of nanopublication information. CWA recommended ontologies are…
</p>

<p>
The primary challenge when nanopublishing data is to model the semantics for clarity and keep a clear separation between the actual observations (measurements) from the interpretations (scientific assertions) and mark-up this distinction in as unambiguous way as possible. Other considerations include economization of memory usage, time-efficient querying, and avoidance of logical inconsistencies.
</p>

<p>
Nanopublications should present as low a barrier as possible to the exposure of data. Hence nanopublications have a minimal requirement of an assertion and provenance, but are extensible. The basic idea is that a minimal nanopublication can be easily created, but the better the annotation the more likely it is that the nanopublication will be found, used and cited by others. In other words, there is strong incentive for rich annotation, but a low barrier to getting started.
</p>
